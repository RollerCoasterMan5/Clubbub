This is our GitHub repository for Clubbub, our WWT Hackathon project.

Follow Kevin's instructions on the document labeled "Clubbub Tutorial" in the shared folder on Google Drive.

Things to do (feel free to add to or remove from this list):
- Get everyone to make a GitHub account (probably using SLUH e-mail)
- Get everyone permissions to edit the repository
- Make sure everyone knows how to use SourceTree to put files on GitHub
- Work on a basic database and some graphics stuff
- Have coders learn appropriate coding languages (Kevin, please put the programming languages we are going to be using here)
- Try to find sometime to meet next week (maybe a rolling thing that people can join whenever they have time)
